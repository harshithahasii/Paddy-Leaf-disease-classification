# Paddy-Leaf-disease-classification

In this project two models are compared.
  1) CNN using tensorflow
  2) Hu moments for feature extraction and fully connected layer for classification.
  
CNN showed better and consistent accuracy so CNN is used.

To design an interface to take an input Tkinter library is used.

# Dataset
Dataset is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
